<br>The libgdx docs are very helpful / necessary
<br>https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki
<br>
<br>To Do List:
<ul><li>Add title screen</li>
<li>Add death screen</li>
<li>Add high score screen</li>
<li>Make enemies</li>
<li>Create menus</li>
<li>Create items</li>
<li>Create stats system</li>
<li>Add music</li></ul>
<br>Bugs:
<ul>
<li>Rarely, a room will not successfully get corridors carved to it (If we cannot fix this, perhaps we have teleportation orb item that transports the player to the stairs. We can start the player with a couple and have them sometimes spawn on the floor)</li>
<li>After changing floor graphics, an odd line is drawn across screen on resize</li>
<li>Some floor rendering errors</li></ul>
