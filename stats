These are subject to change until we feel like our numbers give us a balanced game

static HP(Does not apply to bosses): 100 (The player may have HP boosters, or potions)
static MP: 100
Mana regen: [Player level] per second

Armor damage reduction: 25% + [level requirement]% light, enemies can't hear you approach them
                        50% + [level requirement]% heavy, enemies will hear you approach them

(The following is how damage would work, but we should also consider tweaking numbers based on the attack speed)
Common enemy damage:[floor level * 1.5] (Hard cap at 25, with possible exceptions)
Boss damage: 10 + [floor level * 0.8] (Hard cap at 40, with possible exceptions)

Player damage: (should we consider critical strikes?)
-Fist: Fast speed, low damage(20)
-Sword: Medium speed, medium damage(30)
-Axe: Slow speed, high damage(60)
-Bow: Medium speed, medium damage(25)
-Magic: Depends on spell

Movement speed: The player will move faster than the monsters, to allow kiting

Leveling up will not have stat increases (except for mana regen), but some equipment will have a level requirement,
so while it isn't necessary to kill every single monster in a floor, it is recommended

Throughout the game the player will encounter marked stones, each stone may grant a unique buff. Only one mark may be active at a time.
-Mark of the guardian: The player gains additional resistance to attacks (light armor reduces an additional 15% damage, heavy armor reduces an additional 10% damage)
-Mark of the berserker: The player gains 50% additional damage
-Mark of the vampire: The player heals for 20% of the damage dealt (melee weapons only)
-Mark of the hunter: The player gains additional movement and attack speed
-Mark of the wizard: The player gains additional mana regeneration
-Mark of the alchemist: Potion effects are increased by 50%
-Mark of the ascendant: Upon receiving lethal damage, the player will heal 50 HP, this mark dissapears after usage
